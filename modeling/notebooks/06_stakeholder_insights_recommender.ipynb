    "\n",
    "This capstone project explored how player behavior, platform trends and in-game features influence monetization outcomes across stakeholder groups in a gaming industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Machine Learning and Partial Dependence Analysis, key patterns were uncovered, such as the declining marginal returns of DAU (Daily Active Users) and new registrations, the monetization potential of high engagement segments, and the effects of Genre-Platform strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest with RandomizedSearchCV** emerged as the best=performing model (Test R2 ~63.34%),offering a robust foundation for stakeholder-specific insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **the dataset was intentionally kept with outliers** to reflect real-world scenarios and **preserve signals from high-value users**, which are especially relevant in gaming monetization analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stakeholder-aligned PDP recommender framework delivered actionable insights** tailored for product managers, marketers, designers, developers and publishers, **bridging predictive modeling with business relevance.**\n"

    "\n",
    "* Transform the recommender system into a dashboard (e.g, using Streamlit) for real-time stakeholder interaction.\n",
    "* Automate insight generation using LLMs trained on PDP patterns to reduce manual interpretation.\n",
    "* Enable continuous learning by integrating live game telemetry data.\n",
    "* Expand predictive scope beyond revenue to include churn,retention and satisfaction modeling.\n",
